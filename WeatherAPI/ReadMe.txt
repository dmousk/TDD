OpenLayers 7.2.2
OpenWeather API

@Missing Functions/Methods:

Mobile View:
The map is not displayed
The Degree Radio buttons are not displayed properly
  
PHP file is not implemented in the code therefor the Server/Log buttons doesnt 
display any values

The layer_temp and precipitation_new functions are implemented but i couldnt check their correctness because the 
'https://tile.openweathermap.org/map/temp_new/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?appid={your_app_id}' needed authorization. I sent an email 
requesting a selution from Mr. Pavlos Antoniou but i didnt get a response.
